## [1.0.2] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- Default download layout setting: choose HF cache layout or local `owner/model` folders for LM Studio-style storage.
- Extra local model folders in Settings for scan-only cache discovery.

- Fixed Storage card overflow when Local files layout is selected.

- Improved model search clear button visibility and default model-list column width.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **Data race in WebSocket hub** (`internal/server/websocket.go`): `WSHub.Run()` was calling
  `delete(h.clients, client)` while holding an `RLock`. Since `ClientCount()` also acquires
  `RLock`, both could run concurrently, resulting in a concurrent map write + read (data race).
  Fixed by upgrading the broadcast case to a full write lock (`Lock`/`Unlock`).

- **OOM when mirroring large files** (`internal/server/mirror.go`): `copyFileForMirror` used
  `os.ReadFile` to read the entire source file into memory before writing it. For multi-GB model
  files this would exhaust RAM and crash the process. Replaced with streaming `io.Copy`.

- **Search ignores proxy config** (`internal/server/search.go`): `handleSearch` was creating a
  plain `&http.Client{}`, bypassing any proxy configured via `--proxy` or the settings API.
  Fixed by using `hfdownloader.BuildHTTPClient(s.config.Proxy)` so search requests honor the
  same proxy settings as downloads.
