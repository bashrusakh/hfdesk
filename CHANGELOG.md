# Changelog

## [1.0.8] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- Retry button on failed and cancelled downloads to restart them with their original settings.
- Full README renderer: server-side sanitized Markdown with GitHub-Flavored tables and code, relative image/link rewriting, an authenticated image proxy for gated repos, and lazy-loaded images.
- "Open on Hugging Face Hub" button in the model detail panel.
- Finalizing status on the job card while post-download processing (friendly view, manifest) runs, so a finished download no longer looks stuck at 100%.


### Changed

- Active Jobs now sorts by date added (newest first); completed downloads move to History automatically, while failed, cancelled, and paused jobs stay visible.
- Compact download rows and hide the redundant `main` revision label.
- Model analysis panel now shows the Description (README) below the quantizations list.
- Local cache page now defaults to the list view.
- Web UI version is read from the build automatically (no hardcoded number to edit each release).


### Fixed

- Pause button no longer goes missing after a download starts; it now appears when a queued job begins running.
- Quantization download buttons are disabled while that quant's download is active or queued, instead of letting it be started again.
- Download speed reading is smoothed so it no longer jumps around.
- `max-active` now limits concurrent download jobs: jobs above the limit queue and start as slots free, and lowering the limit re-queues the most-recently-started excess downloads so they auto-resume as slots free.
- Download speed now reflects current transfer throughput over a short window; resuming a partial download no longer shows an inflated speed from already-downloaded bytes.
- tools/reasoning capability badges now also show for cached models, detected from the repo name and tags.
- GGUF downloads now fetch only the selected quant's files (plus any mmproj companion) instead of also pulling the repo's config/tokenizer JSON, `README`, `.gitattributes`, and `fp16/` transformers metadata. Non-GGUF downloads (e.g. safetensors) still include their required config files.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- GitHub Release descriptions now use the matching section from `CHANGELOG.md`.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- Recognize APEX GGUF quantization profiles (`APEX_*`, `APEX_I_*`) instead of showing them as `Unknown`.
- Keep exact download matching working for hyphenated APEX profile filenames.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-06-05

### Removed

- Removed the obsolete multi-select download toolbar from analyzed model results.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- Recognize `MXFP4_MOE` GGUF files instead of showing them as `Unknown`.
- Sort GGUF quantization choices from least-compressed/largest to most-compressed/smallest.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- Release packaging now runs on pushed `v*` tags, so new binaries include the latest UI fixes.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- Default download layout setting: choose HF cache layout or local `owner/model` folders for LM Studio-style storage.
- Extra local model folders in Settings for scan-only cache discovery.
- Local cache rows now show downloaded GGUF quantization types.
- Sticky `Download selected` action above selectable quantization lists.

### Fixed

- Removed the duplicate read-only HuggingFace cache directory field from Settings.
- Fixed Storage card overflow when Local files layout is selected.
- Preserved `UD_` quantization labels such as `UD_Q3_K_XL`.
- Improved model search clear button visibility and default model-list column width.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **Data race in WebSocket hub** (`internal/server/websocket.go`): `WSHub.Run()` was calling
  `delete(h.clients, client)` while holding an `RLock`. Since `ClientCount()` also acquires
  `RLock`, both could run concurrently, resulting in a concurrent map write + read (data race).
  Fixed by upgrading the broadcast case to a full write lock (`Lock`/`Unlock`).

- **OOM when mirroring large files** (`internal/server/mirror.go`): `copyFileForMirror` used
  `os.ReadFile` to read the entire source file into memory before writing it. For multi-GB model
  files this would exhaust RAM and crash the process. Replaced with streaming `io.Copy`.

- **Search ignores proxy config** (`internal/server/search.go`): `handleSearch` was creating a
  plain `&http.Client{}`, bypassing any proxy configured via `--proxy` or the settings API.
  Fixed by using `hfdownloader.BuildHTTPClient(s.config.Proxy)` so search requests honor the
  same proxy settings as downloads.
