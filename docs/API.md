# HFDesk API

HFDesk exposes a local JSON API under `/api`. The web UI uses this API directly.

## Error Format

Errors return JSON with a legacy flat `error` string and a structured `error_detail` object:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": "Invalid request body",
  "details": "unexpected EOF",
  "error_detail": {
    "code": "bad_request",
    "message": "Invalid request body",
    "details": "unexpected EOF"
  }
}
```

## Health

```http
GET /api/health
```

Returns server status, version, and timestamp.

## Search

```http
GET /api/search?q=Qwen%20GGUF&sort=downloads&limit=40&filter=gguf
GET /api/search?datasets=true&q=fineweb
```

Searches Hugging Face models or datasets through the configured endpoint/proxy.

## Analyze

```http
GET /api/analyze/{owner}/{repo}?revision=main&dataset=false
```

Returns repository metadata, files, type-specific analysis, selectable download items, and recommended download defaults.

Important response fields:

```json
{
  "repo": "owner/name",
  "is_dataset": false,
  "type": "gguf",
  "files": [],
  "selectable_items": [
    {
      "id": "q4_k_m",
      "label": "Q4_K_M",
      "filter_value": "q4_k_m",
      "recommended": true,
      "files": ["model-Q4_K_M.gguf"]
    }
  ],
  "recommended_filters": ["q4_k_m"],
  "recommended_download": {
    "repo": "owner/name",
    "filters": ["q4_k_m"]
  }
}
```

`recommended_download` is a ready-to-send request body for `POST /api/download`. It replaces the old CLI-command string contract.

## Plan

```http
POST /api/plan
```

Request:

```json
{
  "repo": "owner/name",
  "revision": "main",
  "dataset": false,
  "filters": ["q4_k_m"],
  "excludes": [],
  "exactMatch": false
}
```

Returns the files that would be downloaded without starting a job.

## Download

```http
POST /api/download
```

Uses the same request shape as `/api/plan`. Starts or reuses a download job.

Notes:

- `repo` is required and must be `owner/name`.
- `revision` defaults to `main`.
- `cacheDir` and global `localDir` are server-controlled.
- Per-request `localDir` is accepted only where explicitly supported by server configuration.
- `routeKey` (optional) selects a configured download route (see Settings). It
  is an internal key from the closed set below, never a path. A configured key
  routes the download into its destination folder (flat mode); `localDir`
  takes priority when both are set.
- Unknown `routeKey` values are rejected with `400` before contacting the Hub,
  including previews via `dryRun: true` or `POST /api/plan`. Exception: when
  `dataset: true`, `routeKey` is ignored entirely — datasets are never routed,
  and the request follows the normal `localDir`/HF-cache behavior regardless of
  the key. This keeps a dataset request that previously succeeded (for example
  a client that always sends a `routeKey`) from newly failing with `400`.
- Duplicate active downloads return the existing job; two requests for the same
  repo routed to different destinations are distinct jobs.

## Jobs

```http
GET    /api/jobs
GET    /api/jobs/{id}
DELETE /api/jobs/{id}
POST   /api/jobs/{id}/pause
POST   /api/jobs/{id}/resume
POST   /api/jobs/{id}/dismiss
```

`dismiss` removes terminal jobs from the UI/state. Running or queued jobs must be cancelled first.

## Settings

```http
GET  /api/settings
POST /api/settings
```

Settings include runtime paths, concurrency, verification, endpoint, proxy settings, the HF cache directory, and extra local scan folders.

Storage fields:

```json
{
  "cacheDir": "I:\\huggingface",
  "localDir": "D:\\Models",
  "localScanDirs": ["D:\\Models", "I:\\LM Studio\\models"],
  "downloadRoutes": {
    "llm/gguf": "D:\\Models\\LLM\\GGUF",
    "llm/safetensors": "D:\\Models\\LLM\\Safetensors",
    "audio": "D:\\Models\\Audio",
    "diffusion": "D:\\Models\\Diffusion",
    "embedding": "D:\\Models\\Embedding"
  }
}
```

`cacheDir` controls where HF cache-layout downloads are written. When `localDir` is set, downloads use real files under `<localDir>/<owner>/<model>`, which matches LM Studio-style model roots. `localScanDirs` are read-only model roots scanned as `<owner>/<model>` folders for the Cache browser and local badges in Hub search results.

`downloadRoutes` is an opt-in map from an internal route key to a destination directory. When a download request sends a `routeKey` that resolves in this map, the job is written to that folder instead of `localDir`/HF cache. Route destinations are also scanned by the Cache browser and accepted by `/api/diskfree?path=...`.

The route key set is closed and server-defined. On `/api/settings`, keys
outside the closed set are ignored and dropped — they never cause a `400` and
are never stored, so a hand-edited or legacy key in the config file is filtered
out on load and is not echoed back by `GET /api/settings`. On `/api/download`,
an unknown `routeKey` is still rejected with `400` (a selector must not silently
become a no-op), except for the `dataset: true` case noted above:

- `llm/gguf` — GGUF quantized LLMs (falls back to `llm`)
- `llm/safetensors` — Transformers safetensors/bin LLMs, including GPTQ/AWQ-quantized models detected via `quantize_config.json` (falls back to `llm`)
- `llm` — any other LLM (internal fallback key)
- `diffusion` — diffusion pipelines / LoRAs
- `audio` — audio models
- `embedding` — feature-extraction / embedding models

Route values are trimmed and `filepath.Clean`ed on save; empty values clear a
key. No directory is created by saving settings.

## Cache

```http
GET    /api/cache
GET    /api/cache/{owner}/{repo}
POST   /api/cache/rebuild
DELETE /api/cache/{owner}/{repo}?type=model
```

Cache entries may come from:

- `HF cache`
- `Friendly view`
- `Local`

`downloadStatus` is one of:

- `complete`
- `filtered`
- `unknown`

## Mirror

```http
GET    /api/mirror/targets
POST   /api/mirror/targets
DELETE /api/mirror/targets/{name}
POST   /api/mirror/diff
POST   /api/mirror/push
POST   /api/mirror/pull
```

Mirror operations compare and synchronize cache roots to configured targets.

## History and Disk

```http
GET /api/history
GET /api/diskfree?path=/path/to/cache
POST /api/diskfree
```

`GET /api/diskfree` defaults to global `localDir`, then configured `cacheDir`,
then the default HF cache directory. An explicit `path` must match a configured
directory (including download route directories).

`POST /api/diskfree` previews the effective download destination using optional
`routeKey`, `localDir`, and `dataset` fields from the download request. `repo` is
not required; other download fields are ignored. Resolution is identical to job
creation: explicit `localDir` > configured route (fine key, then parent) > global
`localDir` > configured/default HF cache. Datasets ignore `routeKey`; unknown
model selectors return `400`, even with an explicit `localDir`. An explicit
`localDir` is accepted as on `POST /api/download`, independently of GET's browsing
allowlist. The response is `{ "path": "...", "free": 123, "total": 456 }` with
byte counts; stat failures return `500`. This read-only check uses the nearest
existing ancestor for a not-yet-created folder, creates no directories or jobs,
and does not contact the Hub. It is advisory: settings and available space may
change before creation; each job's destination remains frozen at creation.

## WebSocket

```http
GET /api/ws
```

Messages use:

```json
{
  "type": "job_update",
  "data": {}
}
```

Known message types:

- `job_update`
- `event`
- `status`
